# RetroDungeon

A small programming project in which I created a simple 3D maze game using software rendering.  

The game is simple, find and pickup a key then head to the door. Rinse and repeat.  
You can also create your own levels! See RetroDungeon Distributable for instructions and examples.  

# Build Instructions
```
gradlew jar
```
The resulting jar file is located in build/lib


### Note
The original game used Minecraft's textures, which are assets owned by Mojang. Therefore, I have replaced the textures with those from XSSheep's Pixel Perfection texture pack. See the README.md in src/main/resources/pixel_perfection for more information.
